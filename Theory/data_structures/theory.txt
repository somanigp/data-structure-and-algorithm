DS: way to store and organize data efficiently

Linear DS: Storing data linearly, one after the other like array, linked list, stacks, queues and hashing
Non-Linear DS: Non-linear arrangement of data. Like Graphs, trees ,

Array: For read heavy applications. Pros: traverse and indexing is fast.
Cons: Write Operations (Insert and Delete) are slow.

LinkedList: For write heavy applications. Pros: Write Operations through head are fast.
Cons: To read need to traverse ie O(n).
